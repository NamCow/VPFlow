Bottleneck detection & AI suggestions:,"System identifies pain points based on user feedback, time metadata, and process logic. GenAl offers improvement recommendations instantly."
Our Mission:,
Powered by AWS:,"With AWS Textract, SageMaker, Lambda, Neptune"
What is VPFlow?,"VPFlow is an Al-powered, centralized platform built to help banks - especially in complex environments like VPBank - to comprehend, visualize, optimize, and continuously improve workflows. Instead of static flowcharts and disconnected SOP files, VPFlow turns our internal into interactive, intelligent diagrams, which we call Dynamic Swimlane diagram (footnote)."
From SOPs to diagrams:,"VPFlow auto-generates swimlane diagrams from unstructured documents, SOPs, and process narratives using fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Deekseek R1)."
Real-time interaction:,Each diagram node is clickable and explorable. Users can ask questions about each step and receive natural language explanations via AI agent. Interactive agent tools that enable users to engage directly with workflows via an intuitive graphical user interface
Knowledge-rich database:,"By integrating knowledge graphs with vector embeddings, the platform constructs a dynamic, LLM-ready context layer - enabling deep understanding of each workflow component."
Page,4 of 25
Continuous learning:,"User feedback feeds into SageMaker's reinforcement learning loop, allowing the system to adapt and improve optimization suggestions over time."
Semantic workflow intelligence:,Amazon Neptune fuses graph relationships and vector embeddings to enable business-aware search and logic validation across processes.
AI model orchestration:,"SageMaker and Bedrock power the extraction of workflows from unstructured documents, bottleneck detection, and contextual responses using LLMs."
Experts/Process,
Bankers:,"visually, ask questions in plain language, and"
Secure and compliant:,"IAM, KMS, and CloudTrail ensure strict access control, encryption, and auditability - essential for financial-grade compliance."
Serverless & real-time:,"AWS Lambda and EventBridge handle SOP ingestion, diagram generation, and user interaction in real time - without infrastructure overhead."

"For Better Comprehend, please watch the demonstration:",https://youtu.be/hY JsGxNuel
Flexible integration:,"Services like S3, DynamoDB, and DataSync support hybrid deployments and easy integration with core banking systems."
1. Redefining Internal Operational Capabilities in Modern Banking,
The,Bedrock/SageMaker: Neptune/DynamoDB:
"Our solution is not only designed for current operations but also serves as an infrastructure for the future of digital banking, enabling:","Neo-banking capabilities, where each process step can self-analyze, flag anomalies, and support FinTech onboarding, identity verification, and anti-fraud operations. Live compliance monitoring systems, capable of real-time process control and auto-generating audit logs. RPA 2.0, where repetitive tasks are automatically identified and proposed for automation without the need for coding."
Page,6 of 25
3. Core Technological and Functional Differentiation,
"2. Existing Tools are ""Isolated"" - Our Solution is an ""Ecosystem""",
1. Aligned with the Practical Needs of the Vietnamese Banking Sector,"Operational bottlenecks (e.g., delayed CIC checks, internal handovers, CRM input errors) are not systematically tracked or proactively flagged. Process updates and improvement proposals are typically manual and lack tools for simulation or performance assessment prior to implementation. These issues cannot be effectively addressed using existing tools such as Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or"
"Our solution leverages Generative AI (GenAl) to analyze SOPs, operational guidelines, and user feedback to:","Auto-generate swimlane process diagrams instead of relying on manual diagramming. Detect logical errors such as missing handlers, infinite loops, or ambiguous conditions."
Why our solution is a good solution? How is it better than existing solutions in the market / competitors?,Because it goes beyond the limitations of

our system enables:,Interacting at each process point - users can access documents or directly ask questions via AI assistant.
Our solution's competitive advantage / unique selling point?,"A ""living command center"" for banks -"
"2. Al-Powered Logic Analysis Unlike current static diagrams,","Capturing in-process feedback from frontline staff - no more scattered suggestions lost in email threads. As a result, the process map becomes a smart operational blueprint that can learn and self-improve over"
1. Auto-generation of Process Maps from Unstructured Text - No Drawing or Configuration Required,"Current tools like Visio, Lucidchart, or Camunda require users to have domain knowledge and manually draw process diagrams. This is time-consuming, not scalable across staff, and prone to inconsistencies. Our solution: Takes input as SOPs, internal guidelines, or PDF documents. Uses GenAl to automatically identify roles, flows, conditions, and related documentation. Generates interactive swimlane diagrams - transforming static documents into living data. This reduces process mapping time by up to 80% and democratizes process understanding for non- technical staff."

Page,22 of 25
Output:,"A simplified, role-specific diagram improves focus, reduces visual clutter, and enhances usability across large, multi-actor processes."
Output:,"A tightly controlled editing environment enhances security, accountability, and version integrity."
Architecture:,"An RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) framework governs all permissions, with every user action logged via audit hooks to ensure traceability."
Architecture:,"User role information is retrieved from integrated identity management systems (SSO/IAM), and the rendering engine conditionally hides irrelevant lanes or nodes at runtime."
Output:,"An audit dashboard provides administrators and compliance officers with a transparent, filterable activity feed, enabling detailed change tracking and governance assurance."
Purpose:,"Maintain a complete and searchable history of all workflow modifications - detailing what was changed, when, by whom, and why."
