Solutions Introduction
What is VPFlow?
VPFlow is an Al-powered, centralized platform built to help banks - especially in complex operational
environments like VPBank - to comprehend, visualize, optimize, and continuously improve internal
workflows. Instead of static flowcharts and disconnected SOP files, VPFlow turns our internal processes
into interactive, intelligent diagrams, which we call Dynamic Swimlane diagram (footnote).
Powered by Generative AI, LLMs, Knowledge-augmented generation and AWS infrastructure,
VPFlow bridges the gap between traditional operations and intelligent automation.
What makes VPFlow different?
From SOPs to diagrams: VPFlow auto-generates swimlane diagrams from unstructured
documents, SOPs, and process narratives using fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Deekseek R1).
Real-time interaction: Each diagram node is clickable and explorable. Users can ask questions
about each step and receive natural language explanations via AI agent.
Interactive agent tools that enable users to engage directly with workflows via an intuitive
graphical user interface
Bottleneck detection & AI suggestions: System identifies pain points based on user feedback,
time metadata, and process logic. GenAl offers improvement recommendations instantly.
Knowledge-rich database: By integrating knowledge graphs with vector embeddings, the
platform constructs a dynamic, LLM-ready context layer - enabling deep understanding of each
workflow component.
Powered by AWS: With AWS Textract, SageMaker, Lambda, Neptune and more, VPFlow
ensures enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.
VPFlow offers a comprehensive experience for both new and experienced banking professionals,
streamlining complex operational processes into accessible visual models.
The platform leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as a fine-tuned version of Deekseek
R1 for diagram generation-and combines knowledge graphs with vector embeddings to build an LLM-
friendly, context-rich database.
Meanwhile, AWS services power the system's intelligence, scalability, and adaptability, making
VPFlow a truly enterprise-grade solution for process intelligence.
Our Mission: To provide a dynamic and interactive platform that makes the integration of Al
technologies-such as Large Language Models, knowledge graphs, and process mining-seamless and

accessible for banks. VPFlow empowers institutions to transform static operational knowledge into living,
visual workflows that evolve through automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
Bankers: to navigate complex internal processes visually, ask questions in plain language, and
propose improvements.
Experts/Process Owners: to receive user feedback, simulate changes, and continuously
optimize operations - faster, smarter, and with full visibility.
Why AWS Services?
AWS is not just infrastructure - it's the intelligence backbone of VPFlow
VPFlow leverages AWS not merely for hosting, but as a modular engine that powers the platform's
scalability, real-time capability, and enterprise readiness:
Serverless & real-time: AWS Lambda and EventBridge handle SOP ingestion, diagram
generation, and user interaction in real time - without infrastructure overhead.
AI model orchestration: SageMaker and Bedrock power the extraction of workflows from
unstructured documents, bottleneck detection, and contextual responses using LLMs.
Semantic workflow intelligence: Amazon Neptune fuses graph relationships and vector
embeddings to enable business-aware search and logic validation across processes.
Continuous learning: User feedback feeds into SageMaker's reinforcement learning loop,
allowing the system to adapt and improve optimization suggestions over time.
Secure and compliant: IAM, KMS, and CloudTrail ensure strict access control, encryption, and
auditability - essential for financial-grade compliance.
Flexible integration: Services like S3, DynamoDB, and DataSync support hybrid deployments
and easy integration with core banking systems.
In short, AWS allows VPFlow to scale intelligently, respond instantly, learn continuously, and comply
rigorously - meeting both technical and regulatory demands of modern banks.

Impact of Solution
How does our solution benefit the society / the target audience?
We are not merely building a tool - we are creating a "second brain" for the bank.
1. Redefining Internal Operational Capabilities in Modern Banking
Our solution is not just a diagramming platform, but rather an Operating System for Workflow Intelligence
- a centralized system that enables banks to comprehend, monitor, optimize, and continuously automate
their internal processes. From a raw SOP file, the system automatically:
Extracts and visualizes the process in a swimlane format, identifying roles, conditions, and
business flows.
Integrates Generative AI to analyze logic, detect bottlenecks, simulate what-if scenarios, and
measure operational impacts.
Transforms each process step into a dynamic interaction point, where employees can click to
read, inquire, give feedback, or suggest improvements.
As a result, the entire operation becomes transparent, measurable, learnable, and continuously
improvable - surpassing traditional Business Process Management (BPM) systems.
2. High Practical Relevance: Addressing Real-World Bottlenecks Identified in the Field
This solution was developed through extensive field interviews and direct observations at banks such as
ACB, VPBank, and Techcombank - where we identified pressing challenges such as:
Fragmented processes without metadata or version control, leading to time-consuming
information retrieval.
Delays in CIC (Credit Information Center) approvals due to opaque, manual underwriting flows
and logic errors.
Unsynchronized CRM data, resulting in misrouted or unprocessed requests.
Lack of a systematic feedback loop, rendering processes "frozen" and disconnected from
operational reality.
Our system addresses these issues at the root by converting operational knowledge into live, queryable
data, eliminating dependence on static documents or manual meetings.
3. Laying the Foundation for Al-Driven Digital Banking
Our solution is not only designed for current operations but also serves as an infrastructure for the future
of digital banking, enabling:
Neo-banking capabilities, where each process step can self-analyze, flag anomalies, and support
FinTech onboarding, identity verification, and anti-fraud operations.
Live compliance monitoring systems, capable of real-time process control and auto-generating
audit logs.
RPA 2.0, where repetitive tasks are automatically identified and proposed for automation without
the need for coding.
The entire system is built on an AWS cloud-native stack, including:
Bedrock/SageMaker: for diagram generation, semantic analysis, and process-related Q&A.
Neptune/DynamoDB: for storing workflow diagrams as analyzable graphs.
Textract + S3: for parsing input SOP documents.
Lambda + API Gateway: a flexible serverless architecture ensuring fast responses and high
security.
This architecture ensures full scalability across the bank without disrupting existing systems, and
seamless integration with core internal platforms (CRM, DMS, Core Banking, eKYC, ticketing, etc.).

4. Social Impact - Enhancing Efficiency Across the Financial Sector
At the societal level, the system brings about:
A more transparent and equitable work environment for bank employees.
Reduced processing time for customer services, especially in lending, identification, and account
opening.
A cost-efficient digital transformation platform for small and mid-sized banks in Vietnam.
In summary: This is not merely a technical solution but a strategic enabler that supports the Vietnamese
banking sector in transitioning to an intelligent, adaptive, and continuously optimized operating model.
Why our solution is a good solution? How is it better than existing solutions in the
market / competitors?
Because it goes beyond the limitations of current tools and lays the foundation for intelligent banking
operations.
1. Aligned with the Practical Needs of the Vietnamese Banking Sector
Based on field surveys and interviews with operational staff at major Vietnamese banks such as ACB,
Techcombank, and VPBank, our research identified several systemic challenges:
Business processes (SOPs, guidelines, forms) are scattered across departments, lacking
centralization and metadata, resulting in difficulties in retrieval and consistency maintenance.
Employees have limited visibility into the relationships between process steps and lack intuitive
tools to understand roles and workflows holistically.
Operational bottlenecks (e.g., delayed CIC checks, internal handovers, CRM input errors) are not
systematically tracked or proactively flagged.
Process updates and improvement proposals are typically manual and lack tools for simulation
or performance assessment prior to implementation.
These issues cannot be effectively addressed using existing tools such as Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or
traditional BPMN systems, which mainly provide static diagramming capabilities and lack business logic
comprehension or advanced analytical features.
2. Existing Tools are "Isolated" - Our Solution is an "Ecosystem"
Most existing solutions in the market (Lucidchart, Visio, Signavio, etc.) are standalone diagramming tools
designed primarily for presentation or static business flow design. They lack business context
understanding, real-time data integration, continuous improvement support, and adaptability to the
complex banking environment.
In contrast, our solution:
Understands the semantics of SOPs and disparate documents to auto-generate process
diagrams.
Links process steps with real-time data, metadata, and business roles.
Enables users to interact, give feedback, and suggest improvements directly on the diagram
interface.
Integrates seamlessly into existing bank ecosystems (CRM, Core Banking, eKYC, etc.).
3. Core Technological and Functional Differentiation
Our solution leverages Generative AI (GenAl) to analyze SOPs, operational guidelines, and user
feedback to:
Auto-generate swimlane process diagrams instead of relying on manual diagramming.
Detect logical errors such as missing handlers, infinite loops, or ambiguous conditions.

Recommend process improvements at bottlenecks using metadata such as time delays, wait
steps, or user feedback.
Simulate the impact of process changes (e.g., merging steps, changing handlers, altering
approval conditions) before deployment.
Incorporate frontline feedback into each process step to enable continuous process optimization.
These features are not fully integrated or user-friendly in current market tools - especially under the
decentralized operations and domain-specific requirements of the Vietnamese banking industry.
4. Positioned as a "Smart Control Layer" Spanning the Entire Organization
Rather than replacing existing systems, we introduce a new control layer that:
Empowers any employee to search, understand, and improve active processes.
Reuses operational data to auto-generate training materials, suggest automation, or flag process
errors.
Converts the entire business workflow into a living graph, enabling leadership to visualize
bottlenecks, access controls, and illogical flows - all in real time.
5. Comparative Assessment with Market Alternatives
6. Full Leverage of AWS Capabilities to Realize the Solution
We utilize AWS services not just for technical support, but as strategic components in our solution
architecture:
Textract: Automatically reads and extracts logic with from original SOP documents, minimizing
manual input.
Bedrock / SageMaker: Powers GenAl core functionalities such as diagram generation, logic
analysis, and conversational interfaces.
DynamoDB / Neptune: Builds process graph structures for bottleneck detection and scenario
simulation.

Lambda + API Gateway: Implements a serverless architecture for cost efficiency, instant
scalability, and secure integration with internal systems.
We do not simply "use AWS" - we architect the solution around AWS's infrastructure strengths, enabling
performance, scalability, and ease of integration.
Our solution's competitive advantage / unique selling point?
A "living command center" for banks - where processes are not only visualized, but also learned,
improved, and self-adaptive.
Our solution offers a unique combination of business process comprehension via GenAl, interactive
swimlane visualization, and continuous process optimization, specifically tailored to the operational
context of Vietnamese banks. While existing platforms (e.g., Lucidchart, Signavio, Camunda) primarily
focus on diagramming or high-level BPM modeling, our solution distinguishes itself in several critical
areas:
1. Auto-generation of Process Maps from Unstructured Text - No Drawing or Configuration
Required
Current tools like Visio, Lucidchart, or Camunda require users to have domain knowledge and manually
draw process diagrams. This is time-consuming, not scalable across staff, and prone to inconsistencies.
Our solution:
Takes input as SOPs, internal guidelines, or PDF documents.
Uses GenAl to automatically identify roles, flows, conditions, and related documentation.
Generates interactive swimlane diagrams - transforming static documents into living data.
This reduces process mapping time by up to 80% and democratizes process understanding for non-
technical staff.
2. Al-Powered Logic Analysis and Process Performance Optimization
Unlike current static diagrams, our system enables:
Clicking each step to view the responsible party, associated documents, and input/output
conditions.
Interacting at each process point - users can access documents or directly ask questions via AI
assistant.
Capturing in-process feedback from frontline staff - no more scattered suggestions lost in email
threads.
As a result, the process map becomes a smart operational blueprint that can learn and self-improve over
time.
3. Step-Level Feedback Integration and Logic-Driven Optimization
We train GenAl not just to read SOPs, but to understand business logic, enabling:
Logic validation - detecting design flaws (e.g., missing handlers, infinite loops).
Bottleneck detection based on metadata, time duration, and user interactions.
Improvement suggestions such as step merging, role consolidation, or automation opportunities.
This promotes continuous, practical, and staff-driven process optimization.
4. What-if Simulation - Model Process Changes Before Deployment
We integrate simulation capabilities to:

5. Built for Banking - Scalable to Any Process-Driven Organization
Our features are designed specifically for banking use cases, including:
Credit underwriting
eKYC and CRM workflows
Customer complaints and account opening
However, the platform is fully extensible to:
Insurance (claims, verification)
FinTech (onboarding, fraud detection)
Large enterprises (HR workflows, internal control)
This is more than a product - it's a "process graph + GenAl + feedback loop" platform for any organization
seeking efficient, transparent, and adaptive operations.
In summary: Our solution is not merely a process visualization tool - it is an intelligent, banking-
specialized platform that connects operations, compliance, and technology into a cohesive ecosystem
that is easy to deploy, scalable across

Image 2: The architecture of our solution
Our solution utilizes a robust combination of AWS services across processing, serving, and feedback
learning layers to provide a seamless, scalable, and intelligent document processing pipeline. This
architecture is designed to integrate document upload, Al-powered processing, vector-based retrieval,
diagram generation, and reinforcement learning for feedback improvement. Here's how we effectively
use and combine AWS services to achieve this:
/diagram, and /feedback) that serve as entry points for various user actions. These endpoints orchestrate
service invocation using AWS Lambda functions.
1. Frontend Interface and API Integration
AWS Amplify hosts the frontend application, providing users with a secure and responsive interface to
interact with the system. Amplify integrates directly with API Gateway, allowing RESTful communication
to backend services.
Amazon API Gateway exposes multiple endpoints (/upload, /retrieval, ensuring a scalable and
serverless backend.

2. Document Upload and Processing (Processing Layer)
When a user uploads a document (/upload), an AWS Lambda function handles the request and stores
the file in Amazon S3.
An Amazon EventBridge rule monitors this S3 bucket and triggers the processing pipeline.
The uploaded document is first passed through:
Amazon SageMaker Endpoint for real-time predictions or quick metadata extraction.
Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform for large-scale or batch processing of document content.
The output is stored back into Amazon S3, from where AWS DataSync transfers it to an on-premises
corporate data center if needed.
This tightly coupled flow ensures automation, scalability, and near real-time availability of processed
documents.
3. Semantic Retrieval and Vector Search
Upon a retrieval request (/retrieval), the corresponding Lambda function queries Amazon
Neptune, which is used to manage both graph-based relationships and vector similarity
search between documents and concepts.
This integration allows for more intelligent retrieval based on context, similarity, and entity
relationships-an essential part of our knowledge graph implementation.
4. Intelligent Diagram Generation and AI Orchestration (Serving Layer)
For requests to generate diagrams (/diagram), a Lambda function fetches diagram data from Amazon
DynamoDB, which stores metadata and previously generated diagrams.
Amazon SageMaker Diagram Generation processes this data to create visual representations,
powered by trained ML models.
These diagram insights are fed into Amazon SageMaker Agent Orchestration, which coordinates
multiple SageMaker tasks including:
Painpoint Detection (e.g., identifying potential data issues or missing insights),
Interfacing with Amazon Bedrock components such as:
Bedrock lightRAG-ChatBot - Provides conversational explanations with Retrieval
Augmented Generation for accurate result.

These diagram insights are fed into Amazon SageMaker Agent Orchestration, which coordinates multiple SageMaker tasks including: Bedrock lightRAG-ChatBot - Provides conversational explanations with Retrieval Augmented Generation for accurate result.

**Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform for large-scale or batch processing of document content.**: 

VPBank®
Bedrock Enhance Suggestion - Offers improvement suggestions based on document
structure and content.
This seamless combination of vector search, generation models, and LLMs ensures rich and context-
aware outputs for end users.
5. Feedback Loop and Reinforcement Learning
Users (e.g., Banker, Diagram expert) can submit feedback on suggestions or diagram quality via the
/feedback endpoint.
This data is written to Amazon DynamoDB (Table Feedbacks) and then processed by Amazon
SageMaker Reinforcement Learning, which retrains or fine-tunes models to improve future responses.
This loop makes the system self-improving, adapting to user preferences and enhancing model
performance over time.
6. End-to-End Seamless Integration
Our architecture is carefully crafted to ensure tight integration across components:
Event-driven orchestration (EventBridge + Lambda) ensures real-time responsiveness.
Data-centric services (S3, DynamoDB, Neptune) serve as persistent and efficient stores.
AI/ML integration (SageMaker + Bedrock) brings intelligence to processing, generation, and
feedback.
Cloud-to-on-prem connectivity via DataSync supports hybrid workflows with corporate data
centers.
Each AWS service plays a specific role, but they're connected in a way that enables automatic
transitions, minimal latency, and Al-augmented intelligence across the entire document lifecycle.
Conclusion
This solution is not just a set of AWS services-it's a well-orchestrated, intelligent system where each
component enhances the Key Capabilities of the other. By using serverless functions, managed AI
services, vector databases, and feedback loops, we provide a responsive, scalable, and continuously
improving platform for enterprise-grade document analysis and enhancement.
